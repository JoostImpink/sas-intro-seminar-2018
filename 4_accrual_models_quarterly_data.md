# Accrual models 

## Modified Jones Model

Inspect the abnormal accrual code to estimate the Modified Jones Model at [https://github.com/JoostImpink/earnings_management/blob/master/earnings_management_models.sas](https://github.com/JoostImpink/earnings_management/blob/master/earnings_management_models.sas) 


## Assignment

1. Adapt the macro to add an option to estimate the Jones model without an intercept. 

Defond and Zhang (JAE, 2014) list commonly used control variables for a abnormal accruals (table 3, p. 291): Size, Leverage, Total accruals, Loss, Sales growth, Operating cash flows, Big-N, Market-to-book, Equity/Debt issuance, and industry-year dummies.

2. Create a dataset with some of these variables, and inspect the sensitivity of the regression of discretionary accruals on these variables whether or not the intercept is included in the Jones model. I.e., estimate the discretionary accruals both ways and regress each of these on the control variables.
